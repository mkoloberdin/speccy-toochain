Zxsend - send file to ZX Spectrum via tape interface.
	(produces output like SAVE would on a speccy)
Public domain by Russell Marks, 1994-7.


Description
-----------

Zxsend produces a sample which, if played at 8kHz from a soundcard
with output connected to a speccy's tape input, is loadable on a
speccy with LOAD "" or LOAD "" CODE. This can be very useful if you
have a speccy with no serial interface (i.e. a bog standard 48k), etc.

Though it's really intended for direct `downloading' of stuff to a
speccy, you could record the output to tape, and load from that later
or whatever.

The defaults for different systems are:

- Linux: output is a raw unsigned sample output to /dev/dsp;
- Sun: output is a u-law sample output to /dev/audio;
- MS-DOS: output is a .VOC file output to `out.voc';
- Other: output is a u-law sample output to `out.raw'.

You can alter these defaults by playing about with the definitions in
the Makefile and zxsend.c, but most can be overridden with cmdline
options. Do `zxsend -h' to see usage help.


Compilation
-----------

Check the Makefile is ok, then do `make' and optionally (as root)
`make install'.


Contacting me
-------------

You can email me at rus@forfree.at but since I'm not on the net, mail
received there is just posted to me at regular intervals by a friend
(and similarly I post responses back to be emailed). It could take as
long as six weeks for you to get a response - if that's a problem,
then you could write to me directly instead (more hassle, but usually
quicker).
